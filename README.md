# jSkype
jSkype creation started when skype4web was released, however at the time I was making a private Skype client in Java, not an API. Samczsun, better known as super salter 9000 was creating an extremely limited api at the time of my client creation and still is today. In order to spare people from his limited api, I'm releasing jSkype.

#Creating a skype instance
Before creating a Skype instance, you'll need to confirm whether or not you login with an email/pass or user/pass. If you login with a username and password, you can create a new instance of SkypeAPI with the arguments (username, password).

Example user/pass: 
```java
SkypeAPI skype = new SkypeAPI("NotGhostBot", "Password");
skype.login();
```

#Sending chat messages
Sending a message to all contacts example:
```java
for (User user : skype.getContacts()){
  user.getGroup().sendMessage("Hi");
}
```
Sending a message to all recent groups and contacts example:
```java
for (Group group : skype.getGroups()){
  group.sendMessage("Hi");
}
```
Editing a message:
```java
Message message = group.sendMessage(skype, "Hi");
message.editMessage("");
```
## Formatting messages

MessageBuilder is the builder class for constructing string that is safe to pass to Group#sendMessage. In order to add text to the message builder, use #addText. Only use #addHtml with past outputs from #build and html code you know is safe. If you'd like to add two message builders together, simply builderA.build() + builderB.build() would work, however I recommend you to pass the old build output to the constructor of the new builder instance, if you want to make a clean message builder. Otherwise, you can use the FormatUtils class for small, quick jobs.

#Example event handler usage:
In order to listen for an event, create a class that implements EventListener, and register it by calling "api.getEventManager().registerListener(new YourListener(skype));" All event's can be found the "xyz.gghost.jskype.api" package and in the event section of this readme file. 

```java
public class ExampleListener implements EventListener {
    SkypeAPI api;
    public ExampleListener(SkypeAPI api){
        this.api = api;
    }
    public void join(UserJoinEvent e){ //If a method has the event as the only argument, it will get invoked once the events trigger(join/chat/leave/etc) has been called. 
        System.out.println(e.getUser().getDisplayName() + " has joined " + e.getGroup().getChatId());
    }
}

public class Test {
    static boolean isRunning = true;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SkypeAPI skype = new SkypeAPI("NotGhostBot", "{password here}"); //login
        System.out.println("Loaded Skype..."); //Tell the user that skype has fully initialized - getting contacts, recent, etc can take a few seconds

        skype.getEventManager().registerListener(new ExampleListener(skype)); //Register listener

        while (isRunning){} //This program is multithreaded and the main thread doesn't get used, so you'll want an (infinite) delay to keep the program open.
        skype.stop(); //Close Skype related threads - shutting it down

    }
}
```
